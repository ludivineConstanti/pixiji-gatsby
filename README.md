# üå∏ Pixiji

This website helps you to train your kanjis (characters from the Japanese writing system) knowledge. But that's mainly an excuse to create interactive pixel art.

The ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° mdDocumentation folder ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° contains some observations made during the project (bugs, research...). Other observations are made in the code itself as comment.

You can see the previous git history of this project on [this repository](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/Pixiji), which contains the 1st version of this website.

This is a portfolio project, so some feature were created, just to make the website easier to go through:

- A cheating mode, that you can change in the menu, is on by default and change the answer's colors to show the right one.
- You can finish or restart the quiz just by clicking on one button (also in the menu, but only visible when you are playing the quiz).
- You have access to all the quizzes (no content is locked).

And some others are following the original concept of being a learning experience:

- The quiz is randomized, so each time you reload, you get different questions.
- It keeps track of the wrong answers, so it will keep asking the same question over and over until you answer correctly.
- The pixel art on the right (when you play the quiz) show you the answers again (and their translation), if you want to spend more time looking at them.
- You can see japanese characters (and their prononciation + translation) on every page of the website (it reacts on hover).
